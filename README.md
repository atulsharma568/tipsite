# Tipsite

Pre-launch landing page for a tipping site for Indian YouTube creators. Fans pay a tip from a creator's page with UPI or card, with no account or email, and can leave their name blank for an anonymous tip. Payments are not integrated; creators can join a waitlist (stored in Postgres) until sign-up opens.

Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind v4, GSAP with ScrollTrigger, Lenis smooth scroll, and one vendored React Bits component (ClickSpark).

## Run

```bash
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build && npm run start
```

The waitlist needs a Postgres database. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`, fill in `DATABASE_URL`, `WAITLIST_SALT` and `CRON_SECRET`, and run `db/schema.sql` once against the database. Without them the site still runs and the form says the waitlist isn't working.

## Where things are

- `PRODUCT.md`: what the product is, what is confirmed, and what must not be claimed.
- `DESIGN.md`: the visual system (colors, type, shapes, components, rules).
- `src/lib/site.ts`: placeholder name, host and sample handle.
- `src/app/actions/waitlist.ts`, `src/lib/waitlist.ts`, `src/lib/db.ts` and `db/schema.sql`: the waitlist (server checks, rate limit, storage); `src/app/api/cron/waitlist-purge` and `vercel.json`: its daily clean-up.
- `src/lib/legal.ts`: operator details and fee numbers used by the policy pages.
- `src/components/hero/TipCard.tsx`: the self-playing sample tip card.
- `src/components/hero/HeroHands.tsx`: the one-shot hand-to-hand lime ₹ note animation, with a reduced-motion still frame.
- `src/components/sections/Differentiators.tsx`: the competitor-led "Why Tipsite" section covering no fan email/account, anonymous tips, QR-first sharing and safer approved text-to-speech.
- `agent-skills/`: the Claude Code skills used on this project, their sources and an install script (`agent-skills/install.sh`).

## Placeholders to replace

Name `Tipsite`, host `tipsite.in`, sample handle `aarav`, the sample creator, and the operator details in `src/lib/legal.ts`.

## What is represented on the landing page

- Competitor strengths we kept: a short creator link, UPI payments, card payments, OBS alerts, text-to-speech, clear sample tip amounts and message moderation direction.
- Tipsite differentiators: no fan account, no fan email, optional anonymous tips, UPI and card in one flow, QR-first sharing and creator approval before text-to-speech.
- Trust rules: every simulated payment, stream alert and QR is labelled as a sample; no customer numbers, testimonials or payout promises are fabricated.

## What is not built yet

The landing page communicates the planned product but does not process money or store data. Real Razorpay payments, creator QR generation, OBS connection, text-to-speech playback, message screening, creator approval controls, accounts and the creator dashboard are future work. The waitlist is the only part that stores data.
