# Progress

Living status of the project. Read this first; it is updated with every commit. Product decisions are in `PRODUCT.md`, the design system is in `DESIGN.md`, the next steps, research findings and owner direction are in `CLAUDE.md`, and `git log` has the detail.

## Current state (2026-10-14)

Pre-launch landing page for a UPI-first tipping site for Indian YouTube live streamers, built with Next.js 16, Tailwind v4, GSAP, Lenis and one React Bits component.

Page sections, in order:
- Hero: headline, subline, a call to action, a hands-handoff animation and a self-playing sample tip card that starts after the hands finish.
- How it works: the steps from link to paid.
- On your stream: a labeled sample OBS alert whose message lights up word by word, like text-to-speech reading it.
- Why Tipsite: no fan account or email, optional anonymous tips, UPI + card in one flow, a clearly labelled sample QR-first sharing treatment, and safer text-to-speech with screening and creator approval in the planned flow.
- Payments and fees: UPI, cards and "We take 5% of every tip."
- FAQ and a closing claim form (sign-up is a stub).

Not built yet: the fan tip page, creator dashboard, backend (Postgres), Razorpay payments and real sign-up. The product name "Tipsite" and the domain `tipsite.in` are placeholders.

## Implemented in the latest landing-page change

Commit `186664c` added and pushed:

- A flat SVG handoff animation in the hero: one hand brings a lime ₹ note, the other receives it, and both retreat. Reduced motion holds a static handoff frame.
- A "Why Tipsite" section covering the competitor-derived choices: no fan account or email, anonymous tips, UPI + card, QR-first sharing and safer approved text-to-speech.
- A clearly labelled non-scannable sample QR illustration; live creator QR generation is not implemented.
- Sample-card labels for optional names, anonymous tipping, message limits and approval-before-play.
- Updated stream copy, FAQ, primary navigation, footer navigation, README, product notes and project guidance.

The landing page presents these as samples or planned product behavior. It does not claim that the backend already exists.

## Not implemented yet

- Razorpay checkout, payment verification or INR payouts.
- Creator tip pages, handles, dashboards or authentication.
- Live QR generation per creator.
- OBS connection or real text-to-speech playback.
- Message-limit enforcement, profanity/banned-word filtering and creator approval controls.
- Waitlist storage, legal pages and contact flow.

## Decisions

- Tips by UPI or card, no fan account. Payments through Razorpay with INR payouts (planned, not integrated).
- OBS stream alerts and text-to-speech of the fan's message, so fans can add an optional name and message.
- Platform fee: 5% of every tip.
- Product edges to carry into the future tip page: no fan email, anonymous tips, QR-first sharing, message limits, profanity/banned-word screening and creator approval before text-to-speech.
- Look: dark, flat, one lime accent.
- Audience: Indian live streamers first.
- Scope for now: landing page only.
- The page stays short, clean and to the point: only what is necessary, and something new rather than a copy of the reference sites (owner, 2026-10-13).

## Open questions

- Does the 5% include Razorpay's payment charges, or are they on top?
- Hands animation in the hero: the polished version is committed "for now" (owner, 2026-10-14). The owner said it is not what they imagined, so a further revision may follow.
- Payout timing, paid highlighted messages, product name and domain, sign-up mechanism.
- Exact message length, moderation settings and the approval interface for text-to-speech (needed with the tip page).

## Next

## Log

- 2026-10-13: landing page built (hero with sample tip card, steps, fees, FAQ, closing claim form).
- 2026-10-13: added the "On your stream" sample alert, OBS and text-to-speech copy and the 5% fee; checked layouts from 320px to 1440px and reduced motion.
- 2026-10-13: published to GitHub; added this file and the working agreement.
- 2026-10-13: reviewed Hyperchat, StreamTipz and SuperTips; recorded the findings, the owner's direction (clean, to the point, hands animation idea), the proposed scope and the next steps in `CLAUDE.md`.
- 2026-10-14: added the hero handoff prototype: flat SVG hands enter with a lime ₹ note, exchange it, and retreat; reduced motion holds a static handoff frame. `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-10-14: added the competitor-led "Why Tipsite" section and aligned the sample card, stream copy, FAQ and navigation around no fan email/account, anonymous tips, QR-first sharing and safer approved text-to-speech. `git diff --check`, lint, typecheck and production build passed; no automated test suite is configured. A production server smoke check also returned the home page successfully.
- 2026-10-14: reconciled `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `PROGRESS.md` and `DESIGN.md` with the shipped implementation, including the competitor strengths retained, the defaults rejected and the distinction between landing-page demonstrations and future product functionality. Markdown diff check, lint, typecheck and production build passed again.
- 2026-10-14: added `agent-skills/`: a list of the 38 Claude Code skills used on this project with their sources, review notes and `install.sh`, which reinstalls them into the git-ignored `.claude/skills/` at the reviewed commits. ESLint and TypeScript now skip `.claude/`, so installed skill scripts are not linted. A full test install matched the installed copies file for file. Lint, typecheck and production build passed.
- 2026-10-14: replaced the hero hands. Three hand-drawn GSAP SVG variants were built and judged; the winner was polished and committed. The fan's hand pinches a lime ₹ note, the streamer's hand closes on it, the fan's pinch opens, and the streamer leaves with the note (about 2.7 s, once, on scroll into view; reduced motion shows the exchange frame). The sample tip card now waits for the hands to finish so only one thing moves at a time. The owner approved it "for now"; it is not yet what they imagined. Also finished the FAQ (fan account/email, card, cost, payouts, OBS alerts, text-to-speech approval, QR code, Super Chat, live status), with no unconfirmed fee or payout numbers. Lint, typecheck, build and `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-10-14: researched Razorpay costs for the fee decision (standard 2% + GST; owner decision still open). Started a visitor-only competitor teardown with REA (`rea-agents@6.4.0`); Hyperchat is done (outputs kept outside the repo), SuperTips and StreamTipz are paused at the owner's request.
- 2026-10-14: reviewed UI references the owner shared (threeui.com, 21st.dev, tasteskill.dev, gsap.com). ThreeUI is a paid, Three.js-heavy library and 21st.dev licenses vary per author, so both are used as inspiration only, with our own code. Taste Skill was already installed. The owner picked one piece: a flat "beam" button (a lime segment runs around a pill on hover and focus; a static ring under reduced motion), now on the hero's "See how it works" and the closing claim button. Lint, typecheck, build and `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-10-14: built the three shortlisted pieces (owner request): a flat "Tip anonymously" switch in the sample card (clears and disables the name field), a stepped-ticks loader on the card's new "Sending" step before the success flood, and a letter-roll hover on the nav, hero, closing and card buttons. Tightened card spacing so the hero still ends 30px above the fold at 1440x900. Lint, typecheck, build and `git diff --check` passed.
