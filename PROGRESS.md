# Progress

Living status of the project. Read this first; it is updated with every commit. Product decisions are in `PRODUCT.md`, the design system is in `DESIGN.md`, the next steps, research findings and owner direction are in `CLAUDE.md`, and `git log` has the detail.

## Current state (2026-10-14)

Pre-launch landing page for a UPI-first tipping site for Indian YouTube live streamers, built with Next.js 16, Tailwind v4, GSAP, Lenis and one React Bits component.

Page sections, in order:
- Hero: headline, subline, a call to action and a self-playing sample tip card.
- How it works: the steps from link to paid.
- On your stream: a labeled sample OBS alert whose message lights up word by word, like text-to-speech reading it.
- Why Tipsite: no fan account or email, optional anonymous tips, UPI + card in one flow, a clearly labelled sample QR-first sharing treatment, and safer text-to-speech with screening and creator approval in the planned flow.
- Payments and fees: UPI, cards and "We take 5% of every tip."
- FAQ and a closing claim form (sign-up is a stub).

Not built yet: the fan tip page, creator dashboard, backend (Postgres), Razorpay payments and real sign-up. The product name "Tipsite" and the domain `tipsite.in` are placeholders.

## Implemented in the latest landing-page change

Commit `186664c` added and pushed:

- A flat SVG handoff animation in the hero: one hand brings a lime ₹ note, the other receives it, and both retreat. Reduced motion holds a static handoff frame.
- A "Why Tipsite" section covering the competitor-derived choices: no fan account or email, anonymous tips, UPI + card, QR-first sharing and safer approved text-to-speech.
- A clearly labelled non-scannable sample QR illustration; live creator QR generation is not implemented.
- Sample-card labels for optional names, anonymous tipping, message limits and approval-before-play.
- Updated stream copy, FAQ, primary navigation, footer navigation, README, product notes and project guidance.

The landing page presents these as samples or planned product behavior. It does not claim that the backend already exists.

## Not implemented yet

- Razorpay checkout, payment verification or INR payouts.
- Creator tip pages, handles, dashboards or authentication.
- Live QR generation per creator.
- OBS connection or real text-to-speech playback.
- Message-limit enforcement, profanity/banned-word filtering and creator approval controls.
- Waitlist storage, legal pages and contact flow.

## Decisions

- Tips by UPI or card, no fan account. Payments through Razorpay with INR payouts (planned, not integrated).
- OBS stream alerts and text-to-speech of the fan's message, so fans can add an optional name and message.
- Platform fee: 5% of every tip.
- Product edges to carry into the future tip page: no fan email, anonymous tips, QR-first sharing, message limits, profanity/banned-word screening and creator approval before text-to-speech.
- Look: dark, flat, one lime accent.
- Audience: Indian live streamers first.
- Scope for now: landing page only.
- The page stays short, clean and to the point: only what is necessary, and something new rather than a copy of the reference sites (owner, 2026-10-13).

## Open questions

- Does the 5% include Razorpay's payment charges, or are they on top?
- Hands animation in the hero (the owner's idea): prototype is built; visual review on phone and desktop is still needed.
- Payout timing, paid highlighted messages, product name and domain, sign-up mechanism.
- Exact message length, moderation settings and the approval interface for text-to-speech (needed with the tip page).

## Next

See "Next steps" in `CLAUDE.md`; that is the single list.

## Log

- 2026-10-13: landing page built (hero with sample tip card, steps, fees, FAQ, closing claim form).
- 2026-10-13: added the "On your stream" sample alert, OBS and text-to-speech copy and the 5% fee; checked layouts from 320px to 1440px and reduced motion.
- 2026-10-13: published to GitHub; added this file and the working agreement.
- 2026-10-13: reviewed Hyperchat, StreamTipz and SuperTips; recorded the findings, the owner's direction (clean, to the point, hands animation idea), the proposed scope and the next steps in `CLAUDE.md`.
- 2026-10-14: added the hero handoff prototype: flat SVG hands enter with a lime ₹ note, exchange it, and retreat; reduced motion holds a static handoff frame. `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-10-14: added the competitor-led "Why Tipsite" section and aligned the sample card, stream copy, FAQ and navigation around no fan email/account, anonymous tips, QR-first sharing and safer approved text-to-speech. `git diff --check`, lint, typecheck and production build passed; no automated test suite is configured. A production server smoke check also returned the home page successfully.
- 2026-10-14: reconciled `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `PROGRESS.md` and `DESIGN.md` with the shipped implementation, including the competitor strengths retained, the defaults rejected and the distinction between landing-page demonstrations and future product functionality. Markdown diff check, lint, typecheck and production build passed again.
- 2026-10-14: added `agent-skills/`: a list of the 38 Claude Code skills used on this project with their sources, review notes and `install.sh`, which reinstalls them into the git-ignored `.claude/skills/` at the reviewed commits. ESLint and TypeScript now skip `.claude/`, so installed skill scripts are not linted. A full test install matched the installed copies file for file. Lint, typecheck and production build passed.
